With *AWS Network Firewall*, you can define firewall rules that provide fine-grained control over network traffic. 
*Network Firewall* works together with [[AWS Firewall Manager]] so you can build policies based on *Network Firewall* rules and then centrally apply those policies across your virtual private clouds ([[Virtual Private Cloud|VPC]]s) and accounts.
