**Amazon SageMaker Savings Plans**Â is a flexible pricing model for Amazon SageMaker, in exchange for a commitment to a consistent amount of usage (measured in $/hour) for a one- or three-year term. Amazon SageMaker Savings Plans provide the most flexibility and help to reduce your costs by up to 64%. These plans automatically apply to eligible SageMaker ML instance usages including SageMaker Studio Notebook, SageMaker On-Demand Notebook, SageMaker Processing, SageMaker Data Wrangler, SageMaker Training, SageMaker Real-Time Inference, and SageMaker Batch Transform regardless of instance family, size, or region. For example, you can change usage from a CPU instance ml.c5.xlarge running in US East (Ohio) to a ml.Inf1 instance in US West (Oregon) for inference workloads at any time and automatically continue to pay the Savings Plans price.
