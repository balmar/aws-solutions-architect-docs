Open standard protocol that allows messaging interoperability between systems, regardless of message broker vendor or platform used.
With AMQP, you can use whatever AMQP-compliant client library you want, and any AMQP-compliant broker you want. Message clients using AMQP are completely agnostic.

AMQP is an application layer protocol that lets client applications talk to the server and interact.
