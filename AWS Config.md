#Compliance 
AWS service where you can monitor and enforce compliance according to defined rules.
In the service you can do either of 3 things:
#### Query
You can easily discover what resources are there in your [[AWS Account|Account]]. You can query by resource type, tag, even see the deleted infrastructure.
#### Enforce
You can manage rules created to flag deviations from defined standards in your [[Organization]].
#### Learn
With *AWS Config*, it is possible to see the full history of the [[AWS Account|Account's]] infrastructure. You are able to see what changed, when and by whom.

### Exam tips
* The best way to check applied standards in your [[Organization]]
* Automation documents or Lambdas can be used to enforce your standards
* You can track previously deleted AWS resources with *AWS Config*
* You can consolidate all your results into a single region
