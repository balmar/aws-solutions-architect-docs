#Scaling 
Moving your application to another machine with different parameters.
It can be automated using monitoring to answer the current traffic needs.

> [!TIP] Should I use [[Vertical Scaling]] or [[Horizontal Scaling]]?
> For most cases choose [[Horizontal Scaling]]. For databases you usually have to use [[Vertical Scaling]]
### Scaling **up** vertically
It means moving to a machine with higher specifications (more [[RAM memory]], [[CPU]] processing power).
The capabilities to handle additional load are higher, but that usually costs more money.
### Scaling down vertically
It means moving to a smaller machine to reduce costs, when you don't need the excessive [[Compute|Computing]] power.
