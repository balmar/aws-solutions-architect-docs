An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a unique numerical identifier for every device or network that connects to the internet. Typically assigned by an internet service provider ([ISP](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/ISP-Internet-service-provider)), an IP address is an online device address used for communicating across the internet.

IPv4 contains 4 numbers 0-255 separated with dots e.g. `192.168.35.4`.
IPv6 contains 8 hexadecimal digits separated by colons e.g. `2620:cc:8000:1c82:544c:cc2e:f2fa:5a9b`
