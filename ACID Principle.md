### What ACID stands for?
#### Atomic
All changes to the data must be preformed successfully or not at all.
#### Consistent
Data must be in a consistent state before and after the transaction.
#### Isolated
No other process can change the data while the transaction is running.
#### Durable
The changes made by a transaction must persist.
