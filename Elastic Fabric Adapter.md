A network device used mostly for [[High Performance Computing]] and [[Machine Learning]] apps. 
Provides lower and more consistent latency and higher throughput than the TCP transport used in traditional cloud [[High Performance Computing|HPC]] systems.
### OS-Bypass
[[Elastic Fabric Adapter|EFA]] creates a direct connection between the application and [[Network]] device. OS kernel is omitted in the communication which boosts latency and performance.
Only supported on [[Operating System|Linux]] [[Elastic Compute Cloud|EC2 Instances]].
