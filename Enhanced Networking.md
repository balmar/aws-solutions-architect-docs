Uses single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to provide high performance network connections.

It offers [[Network|Networking]] speeds of 10Gbps up to 100Gbps

It can be enabled using:
* [[Elastic Network Adapter]] (up to 100Gbps)
* [[Intel 82599 Virtual Function]] (up to 10Gbps, typically on older [[Elastic Compute Cloud|EC2 Instance]])
> [!TIP] When possible choose [[Elastic Network Adapter]] over [[Intel 82599 Virtual Function|VF]]
### Single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV)
