**Compute Savings Plans**Â provide the most flexibility and help to reduce your costs by up to 66%. 

These plans automatically apply to [[Elastic Compute Cloud|EC2 Instance]] usage regardless of instance family, size, [[AZ]], [[Region]], [[OS]] or tenancy, and also apply to [[Amazon Fargate]] and [[Lambda]] usage. 

For example, with [[Compute Savings Plans]], you can change from C4 to M5 [[Elastic Compute Cloud|Instances]], shift a workload from EU (Ireland) to EU (London), or move a workload from [[Elastic Compute Cloud|EC2]] to [[Amazon Fargate]] or [[Lambda]] at any time and automatically continue to pay the [[Savings Plans]] price.
