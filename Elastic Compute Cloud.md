#Computing
A secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
Basically a Virutal Machine inside of AWS, instead of in your data centre.
* You have a complete control over your own instance.
* Pay for your used resources,
* Scale as you need
* Wait minutes to be ready for use
### Pricing options
* [[On-Demand EC2]] - Pay by the hour or second of used resources,
* [[Reserved EC2]] - Pay up-front for 1 or 3 following years,
* [[Spot EC2]] - Purchase unused capacity at a current price depending on free capacity.
* [[Dedicated EC2]] - a physical machine reserved just for your use. Very expensive.

### On-prem infrastructure
On contrary we have on-prem infrastructure, where you need to estimate how much capacity you need in 3-5 years. You expect that your infrastructure would "grow" to your capacity.
